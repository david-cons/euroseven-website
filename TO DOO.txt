Dear GravityMedia Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

My name is [Your Name], and I am currently in the final year of my HBO-ICT studies at Fontys University of Applied Sciences. I have been closely following the exciting work GravityMedia has been producing, and I am impressed by your team's dedication to transforming creative ideas into tangible, strong concepts. It is with great enthusiasm that I wish to express my interest in joining your team as an intern.

During my academic and professional journey, I have cultivated a profound appreciation for the power of branding and concept development, akin to the mission GravityMedia passionately pursues. My experiences have honed my ability to work collaboratively in dynamic settings, closely aligning with your philosophy of proactive teamwork and inventive brainstorming.

As a full-stack developer with a successful track record in freelance projects, I have developed a robust skill set that I believe will complement the innovative and creative spirit at GravityMedia. I am not just a programmer; I am a team player who thrives on contributing to the entire creative process, from ideation to execution. This multidisciplinary approach echoes GravityMedia's commitment to not just thinking but working closely together to invent, design, and build captivating concepts for both customers and the brand itself.

I am excited about the possibility of bringing my technical expertise and creative passion to a forward-thinking team like yours, where we can collaboratively create impactful and engaging brand experiences.

Please find attached my resume and portfolio for your consideration. I am looking forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills, and enthusiasms can be aligned with the innovative work at GravityMedia.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to contribute to and learn from the esteemed team at GravityMedia.
